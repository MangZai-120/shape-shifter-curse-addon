      "content": "Chapter 1: The Shadow of Mutation\nLiam Thorne thought it was just a trivial accident.\nOn that night with the full moon high in the sky, while patrolling the border, a fox darted out from the bushes—its eyes glowed with an abnormal purple light under the moonlight, and its movements were incredibly fast. The scratch on his arm from its sharp teeth was shallow; he bandaged it hastily and put it out of his mind.\nIt wasn't until three months later that he realized in horror that the bite was not the end, but a crack dragging him into the abyss.\nThe change began with his senses. The quiet night of the village suddenly turned into a noisy ocean for him. He could clearly hear the rustling of hay rubbing against each other in the barn next door, the slight sound of feathers breaking the airflow when an owl spread its wings in the forest half a mile away, and even the slow wriggling of earthworms under the soil. These sounds did not come from a distance, but exploded directly inside his skull, sharp and impossible to block. Vision mutated accordingly: the night faded its curtain, and the world in his eyes turned into distinct black, white, and gray shadows. The outlines were sharp to the point of cruelty, clearer than daylight, and also colder.\nTrue fear descended along with the betrayal of his body.\nOne morning, while arranging his collar in front of the ancestral bronze mirror with green edges, he suddenly froze—his pupils in the mirror, under the morning light, had contracted into a cold vertical line belonging to a predator. He tremblingly picked up a razor, wanting to shave off the new stubble on his chin, but the touch from the blade was weird and tough. Not only his cheeks, but the back of his hands, forearms, and even his neck were quietly covered with a layer of fine and stubborn orange-red fur. They grew back immediately after being cut, intensifying, as if a brute force under the skin was eager to break out.\nHowever, what made him tremble more than the physical deformity was the surging, strange desire within his heart. When the neighbor's free-range hen walked to the fence, its lively shaking and the slight pulsation of blood vessels under its feathers made his throat involuntarily emit a low purr, and saliva secreted crazily. A primitive and violent impulse gripped his limbs—he wanted to pounce and tear open that warm neck with his new fangs. This thought made his stomach churn violently; he leaned against the wall and retched, his whole body soaked in cold sweat.\n'The moon... is whispering in your blood.' After examining him in the secret chamber, the old priest of the village stroked the pages of an ancient book wrapped in black leather with rusty silver buckles with his withered, trembling fingers. 'Ancient records call this the \"Shapeshifter's Curse\". The moon's magic is reshaping your flesh and soul. If you don't find a way to reverse it...' The old man's cloudy eyes were filled with pity and fear, 'You will eventually lose your \"self\" completely and become a beast that wanders under the moonlight, with only hunting instincts remaining.'\nIn this isolated small village that followed ancient precepts, shapeshifters were seen as walking disasters, existences that must be expelled or purified. Liam dared not imagine how his father—the former scout captain known for loyalty and honor—would face the reality of his son becoming a monster; nor did he dare to bet whether he would tear apart his childhood playmate or sink his teeth into the throat of a sleeping villager on a night completely controlled by purple moonlight.\nThe choice was painful but inevitable.\nOn a night when a violet crescent moon had just climbed up the pitch-black sky, he placed a short letter under the holy emblem left by his mother and picked up the bag he had prepared long ago. Besides a little dry food, there was only his father's old sword that he could barely wield, and a tattered map secretly stuffed to him by the old priest, pointing to the direction where the antidote might exist in legends.\nHe didn't look back. Alone, he stepped into the vast wilderness shrouded by moonlight and the unknown curse. His figure finally melted into that ominous purple halo, as if he had never existed."

      "content": "Chapter 2: Survival in the Wilderness\nThe days of leaving the village were a long torture of his body being dismantled and reassembled inch by inch. The curse was far more violent than the understated records in the old priest's ancient book. It was not satisfied with subtle influence, but tampered with everything Liam knew at a brutal speed.\nThe seven days crossing the Mist Forest became a milestone for him to completely bid farewell to \"human walking methods\". At first, his toes just itched and throbbed inexplicably, as if countless fine needles were stirring in the bone seams. Soon, the bones began to make slight sounds that set one's teeth on edge. The outline of his soles distorted and elongated in his vision, and the joints bent in reverse, finally freezing into a structure suitable for walking on tiptoe and sneaking like a beast. The leather boots that had accompanied him on mountain roads for many years could no longer accommodate these mutated limbs. He gritted his teeth and abandoned them beside a water-logged tree hole. Since then, he could only step on the cold and damp humus of the forest with bare feet. Every step was a farewell to his past identity.\nImmediately following were the tails.\nThat didn't grow slowly, but after a nightmare mixed with cold sweat and severe pain one night, the end of his spine sent a tearing bloating pain. In the morning, when he struggled to wake up from semi-unconsciousness, a fluffy fox tail with a tuft of snow-white tip was already sweeping uncontrollably behind him. Extreme shame and anger instantly drowned him. He tried to wrap it tightly with the remaining hem of his trench coat, attempting to hide the part that shouldn't exist. However, the balance of his body had been completely overturned. He staggered a few steps and almost fell—this tail was not a decoration, but a new body axis. Without its subtle adjustment, even walking in a straight line became difficult. He was forced to accept it, like accepting a humiliating brand.\nHe wandered on the edge of civilization like a shadow, trying his best to avoid the lights of any towns. Only when his dry food was completely exhausted and he had to replenish the most basic supplies, would he wrap himself in the thick cloak that could completely swallow his figure, pull down the hood, revealing only a pair of eyes that were still too bright in the dim light. But human intuition is often keener than eyes: the innkeeper slammed the door 'bang' before he even approached the threshold; the apprentice of the blacksmith shop would subconsciously reach for the hammer in the corner; even the ragged stray dogs on the street would squeeze out a low roar mixed with fear and hostility from deep in their throats towards his direction.\nThe real warning came from an encounter with a wolf pack in the forest. Driven by hunger, the wolves regarded him as prey, and the encirclement closed rapidly in the dark forest. When the leading old wolf pounced, Liam instinctively threw away the old iron sword that was becoming more and more unwieldy—this movement was so smooth that it startled him. He lowered his body and burst out a sharp, high-pitched roar from deep in his chest, which did not belong to a human at all.\nThe sound wave carried a primitive and barbaric magical pressure, like an invisible whip lashing at the souls of the wolves. The fierce beasts stiffened instantly, pure fear flashing in their eyes, and then whined, tucked their tails, and scrambled to disappear into the depths of the dense forest.\nThe surroundings returned to dead silence. Liam panted and slowly raised his hand. The translucent sharp claws extending from his fingertips glinted coldly in the leaking moonlight. There was no joy of victory, only bone-chilling sadness. Swordsmanship, tactics, human wisdom... were being replaced by these barbaric claws and instincts. He was losing this war with himself.\nThe sleeping posture quietly changed to curling up in a dry tree hole; his taste buds began to reject cooked bread, turning to crave the sour juice when berries burst and the bloody smell of raw meat. But whenever he felt that the wild tide was about to drown his mind, he would use his furry fingers to stroke the roll of rough parchment in his bag tremblingly and forcefully—that was the note of the old priest he copied overnight before leaving. The handwriting was crooked due to the panic at that time, but every word was like an anchor.\nThe last page of the note vaguely pointed to a legendary place in ancient grammar: Moonweep Valley. It was said that the ruins from the beginning of the moon's birth slept there, an ancient altar that might contain the power of purification.\nThis line of scribbled text was the last, and the only, unbroken thin thread between him and the human named 'Liam Thorne'. He gripped it tightly, like a dying man gripping a straw, and continued to stagger towards the direction of the canyon, step by step."

      "content": "Chapter 3: The Eve of the Fall\nJust when hope seemed within reach, fate revealed its most ferocious fangs to Liam. Only one night away from Moonweep Valley, he panted in a rock cave that could barely accommodate him, trying to accumulate his last strength.\nTonight was the Cursed Moon. The moon hanging high in the sky emitted an ominous purple-red glow, dyeing the mountains and forests like festering wounds. In this light, Liam's mutation accelerated to a terrifying degree—a pair of orange-red pointed ears stood completely on top of his head, keenly capturing the whimpering of the night wind; his snout protruded forward, his teeth became sharp and long, and his human face was ruthlessly covered by fox features. He curled up, fighting against the final roar of wildness in his body, and also against the fear of being completely lost.\nHowever, the silence was easily broken.\n'Look, a precious specimen.' A cold female voice sounded at the entrance of the cave, without a trace of warmth.\nLiam's heart stopped. Outside the rock cave, torches suddenly lit up, reflecting the figures of the Illager hunting squad elites. The leader was a witch wearing a large purple pointed hat—Serena. Her gaze was like appraising an object, precise and cruel.\nThe instinct for survival made him grab the old iron sword he had always carried, but his mutated palms could no longer tightly grip the familiar hilt. He tried to swing the sword, but the movement was clumsy and ridiculous. The sword slipped from his fur-covered, deformed palm and smashed onto the rock with a 'clang', the crisp echo announcing how powerless his final resistance was.\n'Poor wretch,' Serena raised the corner of her mouth contemptuously, her voice full of mockery, 'At this stage, do you still want to clumsily imitate the posture of a human?'\nShe didn't even make a move herself, just gently waved her magic wand inlaid with amethyst. Several crimson figures darted out from the shadows like ghosts—they were red foxes, but definitely not natural creatures. They had two swaying tails, their bodies burning with cold green-blue flames, and pure purple light pulsating in their eyes. They were familiars, magical creations whose souls were completely twisted and completely obeyed their master.\nThey didn't pounce and bite, but trainedly formed a circle and spewed scorching fox fire. The flames were not a scattered attack, but precisely formed a rotating ring of fire, trapping Liam firmly in the center. The blazing heat wave scorched his fur and also burned his last hope.\n'Woo—!' Liam let out a desperate roar, trying to forcibly break through the ring of fire.\nBut Serena had already taken out a bottle of potion churning with pitch-black foam from her robe—it was a terrifying mixture of special catalysts and curse corruption fluid. She didn't hesitate to smash the potion bottle on the rock at Liam's feet.\n'Bang!'\nPurple smoke exploded instantly, like living tentacles, frantically drilling into his mouth and nose, penetrating every inch of his fur. Severe pain swept through everything in an instant, far exceeding the pain of any previous transformation. He felt as if his bones were dissolved and then reshaped by brute force, his vocal cords atrophied rapidly, and he could no longer utter human syllables. The most terrible thing was the invasion of consciousness, as if countless red-hot steel needles were piercing his memory and thinking, trying to completely strip the name 'Liam Thorne' together with all the past from his soul.\n'No... I... am... Liam...' He struggled desperately, trying to shout out this final declaration of self, but what rushed out of his throat was only a series of rapid, sharp wails that belonged entirely to a beast.\nBefore his consciousness was completely swallowed by the endless purple-blackness, the last frozen image in his blurred vision was Serena's waveless, pale face, and the collar flashing with weird runes in her hand that was slowly putting around his neck.\nThe cold metal touch pressed against his skin, like the last tombstone falling, burying his short and struggling life."

      "content": "Chapter 4: The Witch's Red Shadow\nLiam Thorne, at that moment, indeed died.\nThe one who survived was the creature known as 'Red'.\nIt was a perfect familiar. Its size far exceeded ordinary foxes, its limbs were slender and powerful, and when standing still, it was like a crimson sculpture. Its coat seemed to be woven from solidified fire, flowing with dazzling luster in the light. Behind it, two fluffy and huge tails were like a king's robe, balancing every explosive movement of it. It could not stand upright like a human, nor could its forelimbs perform fine movements like grasping or opening door bolts—but this did not affect it becoming a deadly weapon born for slaughter in the slightest.\nIt didn't need weapons. Its body itself was a container and channel for magic power. High-concentration liquid magic replaced part of the blood, rushing through blood vessels and meridians. It could 'see' invisible magic ripples in the air through smell, accurately locating casters or magic traps. When running at full speed, the toe tips stepping through the air would leave fleeting scorch marks. It could extract magic power from its chest and spew cold fox fire arrows from its mouth—that was not ordinary fire, but mixed with twisted soul power. Once attached, it was like maggots in the bones, and ordinary water could not extinguish it at all.\nAnd what satisfied Serena most was its almost instinctive alchemy talent. Although without dexterous hands, through the magic link deliberately established and constantly strengthened by the witch, it only needed to lightly touch the materials on the alchemy table with the tip of its nose, and the pure magic power in its body could act like the most skilled hands, instantly completing extraction, mixing, and catalysis. Bottles of excellent healing potions, harming potions, or deadly poisons were born from its seemingly harmless touch. The efficiency and purity even surpassed many human alchemists.\nIt was Witch Serena's proudest work, her most favored claw.\n'Good boy, my Red.' Serena often used her ringed fingers to slowly comb the unique tuft of snow-white hair on the top of its head. Red would immediately lower its ears, meekly squint those blue eyes, and emit a satisfied purr from its throat. It didn't remember any 'before'. Serena's breath, voice, and magic fluctuations were its entire 'world' and 'meaning'.\nIt followed Serena to raid one village after another. The crimson figure shuttled between fences and houses like a ghost, picking out bottles of potions from a special saddlebag, smashing them precisely on the knees or feet of guards like throwing knives, watching them scream and fall in the poisonous mist. It ignited granaries with fox fire. The soaring green-blue firelight reflected the terrified fleeing faces of villagers. There was no wave in its heart, only a hollow pleasure enhanced by magic feedback after completing the task. Every time it 'made a contribution', Serena would reward it with a bowl of warm, greasy meat soup shining with weird purple light. Drinking it, strength would grow in its muscles and bones, while those already thin and chaotic fragments in its mind would be further washed away until they became blurry, until they completely sank into a warm, purple chaos.\nSuch days lasted for a long time. Long enough that obedience became an instinct like breathing, long enough that 'Red' almost forgot that besides unconditional attachment to the witch and the short-lived satisfaction after executing orders, life could actually have any other feelings."

      "content": "Chapter 5: Silent Awakening\nThat bleak late autumn became the season when its world began to shatter.\nSerena received an emergency summon from the Evoker leader regarding a major plan called the 'Moon Marrow Ritual'. She rarely showed a trace of gravity, left in a hurry, and locked Red alone in the magic-reinforced hut deep in the swamp.\n'Guard here,' her voice came through the heavy wooden door, calm but unquestionable, 'Destroy all intruders.'\nRed gave a meek low cry, rested its chin on the cold stone steps, and began an endless wait. It listened to the monotonous dripping sound of the swamp, its gaze piercing through the gray fog, always focused on the direction its master left. One day, two days, ten days... time flowed slowly in silence, like frozen mud. The defensive runes on the eaves that once flowed with purple halos dimmed day by day as the magic link with the master decayed, until they completely extinguished, like a giant beast closing its last eye.\nThe true torture came from within. As a familiar, it could have relied on the magic cycle to sustain life, with minimal need for ordinary food. However, when the link with the master was completely severed, the pure magic reserve in its body quickly dried up like a leaking pool. An unprecedented hunger began to gnaw at it—not just the emptiness of the stomach, but a nothingness that went deep into the marrow and touched the soul, as if the foundation constituting its existence was being emptied bit by bit.\nIt began to pace anxiously in the hut, its sharp claws unconsciously scratching deep marks on the floor. It knocked over the alchemy rack in the corner, colorful herbs and shattered glass bottles mixed together; it tore apart the thick carpet it used to curl up on, cotton wadding flying like snowflakes. The rage caused by hunger gradually overwhelmed reason, and those blue eyes were occupied by a dying crimson.\nFinally, its gaze, as if pulled by an invisible thread, locked firmly on that corner of the bedroom—the heavy oak chest with multiple restriction spells. Even in the hungriest and most chaotic moments, the ban branded deep in the soul was still clear: 'Absolutely, do not touch.'\nBut now, the instinct for survival, like a long-dormant volcano, violently broke through the rock layer named 'obedience'. A low roar mixed with pain and determination rolled out of Red's throat. It opened its mouth, mobilized the little magic left in its body, and a stream of ghostly blue fox fire suddenly spewed out, impacting the magic lock that had already become fragile due to the master's departure.\n'Chi-la—'\nAccompanied by a magic cracking sound like a wail, the lock disintegrated. With a click, the lid popped open weakly.\nThere were no expected emergency dry rations or magic supplies. Only a set of poorly maintained, even rusty old guard iron armor, an ordinary iron sword with no magic fluctuations, and a notebook with a leather cover rubbed shiny and corners severely curled.\nRed hesitated and leaned closer, its nose flapping. There was the smell of sweat from years ago, a faint bloody smell, and a... smell of leather dried in the sun on the iron armor? This mixed scent made its heart tighten inexplicably, and a shudder originating from the depths of its soul shot through its spine. It extended a paw, carefully dialed the diary in front of it, and then used its wet and cold nose tip to gently arch open the cover.\nThose dense texts were just meaningless winding ink marks to it, codes of another world it couldn't understand.\nHowever, when its paw unconsciously pressed on a certain page—where a petal of evening primrose, long dried but still vaguely recognizable as light purple, was carefully sandwiched, an indescribable electric current instantly penetrated its limbs and bones!\nNo magnificent memory images emerged, no sudden 'epiphany' made it remember the name 'Liam Thorne'. It still thought it was 'Red', a fox familiar created by a witch.\nBut, when its gaze fell on the sketch drawn with charcoal on the corner of the same page, with naive lines but full of emotion—those familiar wooden houses, a winding path, the crooked old oak tree at the village entrance—two lines of hot, completely uncontrollable clear tears flowed out of its long and narrow fox eyes without warning, sliding down the fur of its cheeks, dripping on the old paper page, blurring a small patch of dark wet mark.\nAt that moment, the heart felt like it was ruthlessly griped and twisted by an invisible hand. A huge, unwarranted sadness and anger that almost tore its chest apart erupted like dormant earth fire. It looked at the iron sword, a strong impulse driving it to hold the familiar hilt, just like holding a part of itself—but what it raised was only a furry, soft paw pad. It wanted to scream, to question, to roar out the huge waves churning in its chest, but what rushed out of its throat was only suppressed and broken 'whimper... woo...'.\nIt still didn't know what was written in the diary, nor who it exactly was. But at the moment the tears rolled down, an absolute cognition transcending memory and close to instinct, like the first ray of dawn, pierced through the chaos and fog of years in its soul:\nAll this is wrong. This life is a twisted cage. That woman... took away something vital to it that cannot be replaced by any magic power.\nIt must leave. Immediately, right now.\nIt lowered its head, picked up the diary carrying a silent scream as gently as possible, and carefully put it into its accompanying leather saddlebag—where only poisons and healing potions used to be stored. Then, it looked back one last time at the stone house that had imprisoned it for countless days and nights, without a trace of nostalgia.\nThe crimson figure was like a resolute arrow, breaking through the decayed door frame and plunging into the vast, damp, and free wilderness outside. It didn't know exactly where to go, but a weak yet firm voice deep in its soul pointed to the direction where the purple moon hung highest, coldest, and most ominous.\nThere, perhaps lay the answer to sever all this."

      "content": "Chapter 6: Silent Partner\nA two-tailed demon fox can struggle to move an inch in the human world. Everyone who sees it screams and runs away, or raises a bow and arrow.\nIt met Ella and Ryan a month later. At that time, Red found the two trying to break out from a siege of zombies.\nThe burly human warrior lay like an enraged giant bear. He roared and swung a terrifying great axe. The axe blade cut through the air with a dull whistle. Every swing forcibly split open a bloody gap in the surrounding zombie line. Rotten flesh and dark green body fluids splashed everywhere. A little further away, a female archer moved nimbly. Her arrows were precise and deadly. Every arrow was shot from a tricky angle, pinning those zombies trying to sneak attack from the warrior's blind spot to the ground.\nThe coordination was tacit, but there were too many zombies. They surged out continuously from the shadows.\n'Watch your back!' Warrior Ryan's roar was like thunder.\nElla turned around abruptly, her pupils shrinking—three swift zombies had quietly groped to a few steps away from her, withered claws pouncing with a bloody wind. She retreated rapidly and drew an arrow, but the distance was too close! An arrow barely shot through the knee of the foremost one, while the claws of the other two tore open her leather armor, leaving bloodstains on her arm and waist. Severe pain and a sense of imbalance made her grunt, kneeling weakly on the ground, the bow and arrow slipping from her hand.\nRyan's eyes cracked with rage, but he was firmly entangled by the corpse group in front of him and couldn't run back to help immediately.\nJust as the zombie's sharp claws were about to touch Ella's neck—\nA crimson figure shot out from the shadows like a meteor tearing the night curtain! That was not a beast's pounce, but more like a living flame. It emitted a clear cry rather than a roar, instantly attracting the attention of all zombies. At the same time, a few points of ghostly blue fox fire drifted out from it, landing precisely on the zombies, burning fiercely like maggots on bones. The air was instantly filled with a scorching stench and a strange cold breath.\nIn an instant, the zombies threatening Ella turned into burning wreckage.\nRyan finally broke through the heavy encirclement with brute force. His great axe swept across to clear a space. He strode to Ella, the blood-stained axe held across his chest, his heavy chest heaving violently. His gaze full of vigilance and hostility locked firmly on the quiet two-tailed red fox.\nElla endured the pain and grabbed the bow on the ground, barely nocking an arrow, the arrowhead also pointing at it.\nThe battlefield suddenly fell into a tense silence, with only the whimpering of remaining zombies in the distance and the crackling of burning flames.\nRed didn't run away, nor did it bare its teeth and growl low to show the threat of a beast because of being pointed at by weapons. It just slowly lowered its body, then sat down, right on the ground illuminated by fox fire. It raised its head, those unique blue eyes like a quiet lake clearly reflecting Ryan's vigilant face and Ella's pale countenance.\nThere was no fierceness of a predator in there, nor the hollow purple light common to familiars, only a deep calm that could almost penetrate the soul, and a trace of imperceptible... tired kindness.\nIt looked at Ryan for a moment, then made a movement that surprised both of them—it lowered its head, gently arched the crude saddlebag on itself with its nose, and carefully took out a small bottle of potion rippling with pink luster from inside. Then, it walked with light and steady steps to a place a few steps away from Ryan, gently placed the potion on the ground, and arched forward with its nose tip until the bottle rolled to Ryan's mud-stained combat boots.\nHaving done all this, it retreated to its original place and sat down again, as if it had handed over some important token, waiting quietly for the judgment.\nRyan was completely stunned. He looked at the 'healing potion' at his feet, which was obviously not an ordinary product, with bloodshot eyes, and then looked up at the red fox whose behavior was difficult to understand. The axe blade lowered slightly.\nElla slowly put down the bow and arrow. Clutching the wound on her waist, she walked forward with difficulty and picked up the potion that still carried the animal's body temperature. She unplugged the cork and sniffed gently, surprise flashing in her eyes. 'It's the smell of a high-level healing potion... pure and gentle.' She whispered to Ryan, but her gaze couldn't move away from Red's eyes, 'It saved us. And... Ryan, look at its eyes. I've never seen such a \"monster\". There is no madness in its eyes, only...'\nShe weighed her words, and finally whispered: 'Only sadness and determination like a human.'\nRed couldn't speak, so it could only express in the most primitive way. It lowered its head, sharp claw tips digging deeply into the wet mud, scratching slowly and forcefully. The soil turned up, and a crooked but recognizable circle gradually took shape—that was the most terrifying symbol in the night sky, the Cursed Moon. After drawing, it raised its head, its gaze crossing over Ella's shoulder, staring at the distant horizon for a long time. There, a hideous tower pierced the dark clouds. Even from a long distance, one could feel the ominous aura it emitted. It pointed firmly in that direction with its nose tip.\nElla followed its gaze and her heart shivered. 'You want to go there? That tower of the Pillagers?'\nRed let out a short and low cry from its throat and nodded heavily. Under the moonlight, the outline of the distant tower was reflected in its blue eyes, as if silent flames were burning.\n'Do you know what that means?' Ryan said gruffly, stopping the hand wiping the axe handle, 'That place is a demon's den, the nest of those bastards. Going there is seeking death.'\nRed didn't make more movements, nor did it growl excitedly. It just turned its gaze back, looking quietly and deeply into Ella's eyes. There was no anxiety of a beast in that gaze, no begging, only a near-transparent determination, and a desperate gamble of putting all trust. It condensed its unspeakable past, the curse that couldn't dissipate, and all the reasons pointing to that tower into this one look.\nElla fell silent in that gaze. She exchanged a look with Ryan and walked aside to discuss in a low voice. The firelight elongated their shadows, and occasionally a few vague words came: '...saved us', '...eyes are different', '...must be a reason'. Red sat patiently on the spot, like a crimson stone statue, only the slightly heaving chest proving its life.\nA long time later, Ella walked back. She squatted down, looking at Red at eye level as much as possible, her voice clear and solemn: 'We will go with you.'\nFrom that moment on, a peculiar team was born. Red naturally became the eyes and ears of the team, and the most unexpected supporter. It couldn't wield swords, but that crimson figure was so fast when shuttling through the forest that only a glimpse remained; it could warn of danger long in advance, and a trace of unusual decay or metallic smell in the wind couldn't escape its nose tip. In battle, it was incredibly agile, always able to maneuver in the gap between axe winds and arrows, slamming away the skeleton arm that was about to scratch Ella's ankle with its not-so-strong body, or precisely tossing a healing potion tightly held in its claws to within Ryan's reach the moment he parried. The inconspicuous small saddlebag on its back seemed to connect to another space, always able to take out herbs to relieve fatigue, antidotes, or poisonous potions that made enemies miserable at the right time.\nAlthough it never uttered a word, a silent understanding was tempered in countless life-and-death struggles. They learned to recognize the angle of its ear turning and the frequency of its tail swinging; those were its language.\nThe camp at night was the most peaceful time, and also the time when thoughts were most revealed. Ryan polished his beloved great axe by the firelight, and Ella mended the worn leather armor by the moonlight. And Red would always curl up quietly at the edge of the firelight, carefully spreading out the diary with worn edges in front of itself. It couldn't read those winding texts, but its gaze would linger on the yellowed pages for a long time, especially the page sandwiching a dried evening primrose. It extended a paw, not to turn the page, but to brush over the fragile plant and the handwriting beside it extremely lightly and softly, as if touching a fragile dream, a hometown that could not be returned to.\nThe firelight danced in its focused blue eyes, illuminating a deep emotion far beyond beasts. Ryan and Ella looked at such a Red, and the initial doubt and estrangement in their hearts had long been replaced by a quiet realization.\nThey understood that walking beside them was not a cursed beast.\nWithin that red fox's body was imprisoned a wounded but unyielding, noble soul."

      "content": "Chapter 7: Raid on the Obsidian Fortress\nOn the day of the decisive battle, the sky hung low, and the 'Cursed Moon' hung above the Obsidian Fortress like a pulsating evil heart. Although the moonlight was thick enough to be almost liquid, dyeing the entire mountain range into a ghostly purple-red.\nInside the fortress, the evil ritual had reached its climax. Relying on Red's instinctive perception of Illager aura and magic veins, they moved like shadows through the heavily guarded corridors and halls, avoiding several patrols, and finally reached the core hall.\nHowever, the final line of defense could not be bypassed, and the battle was tragic beyond the limit that flesh and blood could bear.\nThe skylight of the hall dome was open, and a thick, solid purple light column fell from the 'Cursed Moon', becoming the energy core of the entire evil ritual. Under the light column stood the existence that had shaped and imprisoned everything about Red—Witch Serena. Beside her stood the tyrant of the Pillager legion, a giant clad in heavy armor and holding an enchanted great axe haunted by ominous black gas. Just standing there, he emitted a mountain-like oppression.\n'Oh my...' Serena's gaze swept over Ella and Ryan, finally riveting on Red, the corner of her mouth curling up in a cold and twisted smile, 'Look who it is? My lost... little pet. Have you wandered enough and come back to beg for your master's forgiveness?'\n'Woo—Roar—!!!'\nThe moment it saw Serena, the pain accumulated over years, the nothingness transformed from erased memories, and the anger gnawing at the soul day and night after waking up, erupted like a suppressed volcano! Red let out a roar that resounded through the hall, mixing fox howl with some remnant human wail. The two tails behind it suddenly fluffed up like battle flags, every hair bursting with blinding azure light! The accumulated fox fire was no longer reserved, turning into a surging wall of flames several meters high, booming towards Serena and the tyrant with Ryan's battle axe in a desperate momentum to burn everything!\nThe tyrant moved. The great axe did not block, but slashed frontally with pure brute force! The axe blade tore through the wall of fire, and the exploding shock wave cracked the ground stone slabs into spider webs. In a collision of strength against strength without any fancy tricks, the steel shield engraved with Ryan's family crest shattered instantly! He smashed against the distant stone wall like a kite with a broken string, slid to the ground with a muffled sound, and moved no more.\n'Ryan!' As soon as Ella's scream came out, several Vexes condensed from resentment and purple moon energy penetrated her arrow blockade like ghosts, their sharp swords deeply embedded in her shoulder and ribs. She fell coughing up blood, the bow in her hand clattering to the ground, her vision rapidly eroded by blood color and darkness.\nRed wanted to pounce on Ella, but a cold chain from the soul level suddenly tightened—Serena's immobilization spell hit him precisely. Magic entangled its limbs like ice chains. It could only crawl on the ground in humiliation, watching its teammates fall, squeezing broken whimpers from its throat.\nSerena walked to Red with elegant and cruel steps, looking down at its struggling appearance. Under the blasphemous purple moonlight, she held high a dagger with a weird shape and a blade engraved with wriggling runes, the cold light reflecting the pure indifference and desire for control in her eyes.\n'What a touching friendship, and how... stupid.' Her voice was as soft as a snake flicking its tongue, 'Since you can't learn loyalty, then stay by my side in an eternal way. Your fur and bones will become the most special piece in my collection.'\nDespair, like the deepest ice water, drowned Red's chest. It looked at Ryan whose life or death was unknown, at Ella whose breath was weak in the pool of blood, and finally at the moon outside the skylight that was so oddly purple as if mocking all beings. Amidst the violent struggle, the sheepskin diary slipped out of its saddlebag and lay open on the ground—exactly the page sandwiching the withered evening primrose.\nIn a trance, the faded ink marks and the withered petals seemed to overlap, and a distant and firm voice penetrated the barrier of time and the mist of memory, echoing weakly but clearly in the depths of the soul:\n'No matter what I become... I must protect...'\nProtect.\nThis word, like the final key, suddenly opened all the locks of entanglement and confusion. It didn't come to find a way to turn back into Liam Thorne—that human named Liam had already passed away in the purple smoke many years ago. It came here, crossing wilderness and battles, enduring loneliness and pain, not for the purpose of 'going back' at all.\nBut for the end.\nTo end this source that created countless tragedies, twisted lives, and blasphemed the moonlight. To end Serena's ambition, to end the tyrant's tyranny, to end all curses projected by this 'Cursed Moon'!\nIts gaze fell on its chest—where hung an old metal ring of unknown use found by chance on the road, engraved with patterns of stars and crescents on the edge: Moon Marrow Cross Ring.\nA segment of almost forgotten ancient proverb roared like a warning bell at this moment: 'Moon Marrow Ring, only entrusted when the Cursed Moon is at its peak... can contain the brilliance of overload, break the shackles of form... but the life of the walker is also fuel for it.'\nThe price is... life.\nBut, enough.\nIn Red's eyes, that deep blue, under the reflection of the purple moonlight, ignited a calm and resolute flame for the last time."

      "content": "Chapter 8: Lord of the Spirit Realm\nRed suddenly raised its head, bones in its neck cracking crisply. It didn't use the last remaining magic for attack or escape, but poured it all into its limbs, forcibly shattering the frozen shackles on the soul level! The moment the restraints disintegrated, it didn't hesitate at all, lowered its head, and bit fiercely towards its neck with sharp canine teeth—\nCrack.\nThat ancient Moon Marrow Cross Ring shattered in response.\nNot shattering, but releasing. The ancient starlight imprisoned within the ring and Red's accumulated magic turned into a silent ripple spreading out.\n'Awoo——————!!!'\nWhat burst out next was a fox howl transcending the auditory category. The sound wave wrapped the broken ring runes and Red's resolute will, exploding in a ring shape. All window lattices, crystal chandeliers, and even magic embedded pieces on the walls in the hall were shaken into powder instantly!\nAbove the sky dome, that 'Cursed Moon' trembled violently, as if drawn by this wail. All the scattered, diffuse purple moonlight nourishing the evil ritual, like hundreds of rivers returning to the sea, suddenly contracted and condensed, turning into a destruction light column several meters in diameter, solid as liquid amethyst, pouring in from the skylight with a boom, completely swallowing Red's figure!\n'What is that?! Stop it! Quick!' Serena's gaffe scream was drowned in the roar of pure energy.\nToo late.\nInside the light column, Red's form began to disintegrate. The flame-like fur vaporized first, revealing the meridians shining with ghostly blue luster below; flesh and blood did not rot, but sublimated into bits of starlight; bones were recast in melting, emitting the sound of metal and stone clashing. That was not demise, but a grand and painful sacrifice—using the old, cursed 'existence' as firewood to ignite a higher birth.\nWhen the blinding light gradually faded, what appeared in place was no longer the familiar of the past.\nIt was an elegant, majestic spiritual existence flowing with a quiet aura of destruction. Its size was nearly doubled, and the originally crimson fur turned into profound dark blue, with nebula vortices seemingly rotating slowly within. It still stepped on the earth, but the space under its four feet slightly distorted, rippling out circles of light blue. The most striking were the two tails—they had completely turned into pure spiritual flames, no longer solid, the tail tips dancing with ghostly light blue halos, dragging dreamlike light trails in the air. And on its chest, where the collar was once bound, a complex and precise blue rune rotating slowly by itself shone brightly, like a third eye, staring coldly at the world.\nRed, the 'Red' as a familiar, ceased to exist.\nWhat descended at this moment was the one in charge of the dark side of the moon, governing the authority of curse and end—\nLord of the Spirit Realm.\nThe chain magic missiles hurriedly shot by Serena, upon touching the psionic field naturally rippling around it, annihilated silently like snowflakes falling into hot iron. The Pillager tyrant let out a roar like a trapped beast, waving the great axe that had shattered the shield and was haunted by black gas, hacking down with full force like splitting a mountain!\nThe Lord of the Spirit Realm didn't even look straight at him, just tilted its head slightly, and a spiritual fire tail behind it rose casually as if having an independent will, swiping lightly.\nClang—!\nA crisp breaking sound rang out. The enchanted Netherite axe blade capable of cutting through fine steel snapped in two. The tail's momentum didn't dissipate, hitting the tyrant's chest frontally like an invisible giant hammer. That mountain-like body immediately shot backward like a stone thrown by a trebuchet, embedding fiercely into a distant stone pillar. Spider-web-like cracks instantly spread throughout the pillar, and he breathed no more.\nSerena finally slumped to the ground, blood draining from her face, lips trembling: 'No... this shouldn't exist... this power... is taboo...'\nThe Lord of the Spirit Realm paced forward slowly, light frost condensing on the ground it stepped on. It still couldn't speak, but those eyes burning with eternal blue flames needed no language. There was no hatred, no pleasure, only an absolute judgment meaning belonging to a higher law.\nIt stopped a few steps in front of the witch and slowly opened its mouth. Not to bite. inside the mouth, a point of extreme blue gloom began to compress and condense crazily, and the surrounding space collapsed inward because of it, emitting a low hum.\nThe last thing reflected in Serena's pupils was the blue star swallowing all light, and the bottomless, calm meaning of end in the eyes of the Lord of the Spirit Realm.\nBoom——————!!!\nA devastating blue light stream surged out, instantly swallowing Serena's body, the evil altar behind her, the rune pedestal carrying the ritual, and even the heavy obsidian wall at the rear of the hall. Where the light reached, matter returned to nothingness.\nThe entire fortress began to groan under the overwhelming burden, and amidst the earth-shaking vibration, it collapsed layer by layer from top to bottom.\nThe Lord of the Spirit Realm stood in the center of the constantly falling boulders and churning energy turbulence, its ghostly blue figure like the eye of a storm, serene, and eternal."

      "content": "Epilogue: Legend of the Moon Glow\nWhen the first ray of true dawn pierced the curtain of the long dark night like molten platinum, the eerie 'Cursed Moon' in the sky finally exhausted its last trace of strength and sank silently below the horizon, leaving only a faint, rapidly fading purple smudge in the sky.\nThe Obsidian Fortress had turned into a smoking ruin of jagged teeth. Ella dragged a leg that could barely move, supporting the unconscious Ryan, staggering forward among the rubble. Every call pulled the wound on her shoulder blade pierced by the Vex, bringing burning severe pain.\n'Red! Red—! Answer me!'\nHer voice echoed over the empty ruins, carrying increasing panic. Dust, shattered magic crystals, and a scorched smell filled the air.\nFinally, on a relatively flat broken stone slab whose edges were scorched black by moonlight, she found it.\nThe magnificent form of the Lord of the Spirit Realm had dissipated. Curling up there at this moment was the original appearance—that not-so-strong red fox with two fluffy tails. It lay on its side, body slightly curled, in a posture relaxed to the point of peacefulness. That signature orange-red coat still shimmered with flame-like luster under the dawn, clean and intact, without any wounds or stains left by the battle.\nHowever, the once warm heaving arc of its chest had stilled. Those eyes that had reflected complex emotions—sometimes confused, sometimes firm, and finally turned into divine majesty—were tightly closed at this moment. Long eyelashes cast shallow shadows on the pale face, the expression peaceful, as if it had just fallen into a dreamless, exceptionally deep sleep.\nThe sheepskin diary that witnessed all its struggles and existence was spread out in front of its small, black nose tip, intact. The wind turned the pages, finally stopping on that withered evening primrose.\nElla's fingers trembled uncontrollably. She fell on her knees on the cold stone slab, reached out, and carefully checked its breath. What came from her fingertips was only the gradually dissipating residual warmth and a heartbreaking silence. No breathing. On this continent filled with miracles and curses, potions and magic, there are always some laws higher than everything, and some prices that even the most taboo rituals cannot redeem.\nIt paid everything it could pay. Magic, body, and even that wisp of soul fire constituting 'existence' itself, all ignited the light that illuminated the darkness and ended the curse at that moment.\nA suppressed-to-the-extreme whimper squeezed out of Ella's throat, immediately turning into uncontrollable wailing. She leaned down and buried her face deeply in the fur on Red's neck that was still soft but rapidly losing temperature. Tears mixed with blood stains soaked that bright crimson. Above the ruins, only the sad wind whimpered, echoing the elegy of humans losing a Comrade-in-arms and the world losing a nameless guardian.\n...\nTime passed. In the ballads sung by bards and the whispers of travelers around the stove at night later, there was another version of the ending of that decisive battle:\nThey say that on every night when the 'Cursed Moon' rises again, if you harbor pure kindness but unfortunately get lost in the dense forest, or are covered by monsters due to whispers in the dark, you might be lucky enough to witness a miracle.\nOn the top of distant hills, or at the boundary of the mist forest, a two-tailed fox spirit body will appear. It is surrounded by quiet and eternal ghostly and blue spiritual fire, as if draping a starry sky over its body. It will not speak, nor ever approach, only standing quietly at the junction of moonlight and shadow.\nIts eyes burning with blue flames will look at you across the distance. There are no words in that gaze, but it seems to be able to disperse all the wriggling malice and cold fear around.\nThen, you will find the entangled thorns on the road you came from quietly retreating, the uneasy rustling sound gradually fading away, and a path illuminated by hazy moonlight clearly appears under your feet, leading to the direction of home.\nThe poets lower their voices and tell you with awe and nostalgia:\nThat is not the wandering of a dead soul.\nThat is the last Lord of the Spirit Realm on this land that has borne too much pain, fulfilling a vow never spoken in its only known way.\nIt became the most silent and most loyal under the moonlight—\nEternal Night Watcher."
