      "content": "Chapter 1: The Shadow of Mutation\nLiam Thorne once thought it was nothing more than a trivial accident.\nOn that night when the full moon hung high, patrolling the border, a fox darted out from the bushes—its eyes glowing with an unnatural purple light under the moon, moving faster than any ordinary creature. The scratch on his arm from its sharp teeth was shallow; he bandaged it hastily and put it out of his mind.\nIt wasn't until three months later that he realized with horror that the bite was not the end, but a fissure dragging him into the abyss.\nThe change began with his senses. The quiet night of the village suddenly turned into a noisy ocean for him. He could clearly hear the rustling of hay rubbing against each other in the barn next door, the slight sound of owl feathers breaking the air in the woods half a mile away, and even the slow wriggling of earthworms under the soil. These sounds did not come from afar, but exploded directly inside his skull, sharp and impossible to block out. His vision changed with it: the night shed its curtain, and the world in his eyes turned into distinct shades of black, white, and gray, with outlines so sharp they were almost cruel, clearer than day, and colder too.\nTrue fear descended along with the betrayal of his body.\nOne morning, while adjusting his collar in front of the ancestral bronze mirror whose edges had turned green, he froze—his pupils in the mirror, under the morning light, had contracted into a cold vertical slit belonging to a predator. Trembling, he picked up a razor to shave the new stubble on his chin, but the touch from the blade was strange and tough. It wasn't just his cheeks; his hands, forearms, and even his neck were quietly covered with a layer of fine and stubborn orange-red fur. They grew back as soon as they were cut, intensifying, as if a savage force under his skin was eager to break out.\nHowever, what made him shudder more than the physical deformity was the strange desire surging within. When the neighbor's free-range hen strutted to the fence, its lively shaking and the slight pulse of blood vessels under its feathers made his throat involuntarily emit a low purr, and saliva secreted frantically. A primitive and violent impulse gripped his limbs—wanting to pounce and tear that warm neck open with his new fangs. The thought made his stomach churn violently; he leaned against the wall and retched, soaked in cold sweat.\n\"The moon... is whispering in your blood.\" After examining him in the secret chamber, the old village priest's withered fingers trembled as they brushed over the pages of an ancient book bound in black leather with rusted silver clasps. \"Ancient records call this the 'Curse of the Shapeshifter'. The moon's magic is reshaping your flesh and soul. If a way to reverse it is not found...\" The old man's cloudy eyes were full of pity and fear, \"You will eventually lose your 'self' completely, reduced to a beast wandering under the moonlight, left with only hunting instincts.\"\nIn this isolated village that followed ancient precepts, shapeshifters were seen as walking disasters, existences that must be expelled or purified. Liam dared not imagine how his father—the former sentry captain known for loyalty and honor—would face the reality of his son becoming a monster; nor did he dare to gamble whether, on a night completely controlled by the purple moonlight, he would tear apart his childhood playmate or sink his teeth into the throats of sleeping villagers.\nThe choice was painful but inevitable.\nOn a night when a violet crescent moon just climbed onto the pitch-black sky, he placed a brief letter under the holy emblem left by his mother and shouldered the pack he had prepared long ago. Besides a little dry food, the pack contained only his father's old sword, which he could barely wield, and a tattered map secretly stuffed into his hand by the old priest, pointing to a legendary place where a cure might exist.\nHe did not look back. Alone, he stepped into the vast wilderness shrouded by moonlight and unknown curses. His figure eventually melted into that ominous purple halo, as if he had never existed."

      "content": "Chapter 2: Survival in the Wilderness\nThe days after leaving the village were a long torture of his body being dismantled and reassembled inch by inch. The curse was far more violent than the understated records in the old priest's ancient book; it was not satisfied with subtle influence, but tampered with everything Liam knew with almost brute speed.\nThe seven days crossing the misty forest became a milestone for his complete farewell to \"walking like a human\". At first, his toes just itched and throbbed inexplicably, as if countless fine needles were stirring in the bone gaps. Soon, the bones began to make tooth-aching slight sounds, the contours of his feet distorted and elongated in his vision, joints bent in reverse, and finally fixed into a structure suitable for walking on tiptoe, stalking like a beast. The leather boots that had accompanied him on mountain roads for many years could no longer accommodate these mutated limbs. Gritting his teeth, he abandoned them by a waterlogged tree hollow. Since then, he could only tread barefoot on the cold and damp humus of the forest. Every step was a farewell to his past identity.\nFollowing closely was the tail.\nIt wasn't a slow growth, but after a nightmare mixed with cold sweat and severe pain, a tearing distension came from the end of his spine. In the morning, when he struggled to wake up from semi-unconsciousness, a fluffy fox tail with a tuft of snow-white fur at the tip was already sweeping uncontrollably behind him. Extreme shame and anger drowned him instantly. He tried to wrap it tightly with the remaining hem of his trench coat, trying to hide the part that shouldn't exist. However, his body's sense of balance had been completely overturned. He staggered a few steps and almost fell—this tail was not a decoration, but a new body axis. Without its subtle adjustment, even walking in a straight line became difficult. He was forced to accept it, like accepting a humiliating brand.\nHe wandered on the edge of civilization like a shadow, trying his best to avoid the lights of any town. Only when dry food ran out completely and he had to replenish basic supplies, would he wrap himself in that heavy cloak that could swallow his figure completely, pull down his hood, revealing only eyes that were still too bright in the dim light. But human intuition is often sharper than eyes: the innkeeper slammed the door before he even approached the threshold; the blacksmith's apprentice would subconsciously reach for the hammer in the corner; even the ragged stray dogs on the street would squeeze out low growls mixed with fear and hostility from their throats towards his direction.\nThe real warning came from an encounter with a wolf pack in the forest. Driven by hunger, the wolves regarded him as prey, and the encirclement closed rapidly in the gloomy woods. When the leading alpha wolf pounced, Liam instinctively threw away the increasingly unwieldy old iron sword—the movement was so smooth it startled him. He crouched low, and a sharp, high-pitched roar that definitely did not belong to a human burst out from deep within his chest.\nThe sound wave carried a primitive and wild magical pressure, like an invisible whip lashing at the souls of the wolves. The fierce beasts stiffened instantly, pure fear flashing in their eyes, then they whimpered, tucked their tails, and scrambled to disappear into the depths of the dense forest.\nSilence returned. Liam panted, slowly raising his hand. The translucent sharp curved claws extending from his fingertips glinted coldly in the leaking moonlight. There was no joy of victory, only bone-chilling sorrow. Swordsmanship, tactics, human wisdom... were being replaced by these savage fangs and instincts. He was losing this war with himself.\nHis sleeping posture quietly changed to curling up in dry tree hollows; his taste buds began to reject cooked bread, craving instead the sour juice of bursting berries and the bloody smell of raw meat. But whenever he felt that wild tide about to drown his sanity, he would use his fur-covered fingers to stroke the roll of rough parchment in his pack heavily and tremblingly—it was the notes of the old priest he had copied overnight before leaving. The handwriting was crooked due to panic at the time, but every word was like an anchor.\nThe last page of the notes vaguely pointed to a legendary place in ancient grammar: Moon Weeping Canyon. It is said that ruins from the beginning of moonlight lie dormant there, an ancient altar that might contain the power of purification.\nThis line of scrawled text was the last, and the only, unbreakable thread between him and the human named \"Liam Thorne\". He clutched it, like a dying man clutching a straw, and continued to stumble towards the canyon, step by step."

      "content": "Chapter 3: Eve of the Fall\nJust when hope seemed within reach, fate revealed its most hideous fangs to Liam. Only one night away from Moon Weeping Canyon, he panted in a barely habitable rock cave, trying to gather his last strength.\nTonight was the Cursed Moon. The moon hanging high in the sky emitted an ominous purple-red glow, soaking the mountains and forests like a festering wound. Under this light, Liam's mutation accelerated to a terrifying degree—a pair of orange-red pointed ears stood completely atop his head, keenly capturing the whimpering of the night wind; his snout protruded forward, teeth became long and sharp, human features being ruthlessly covered by fox characteristics. He curled up, fighting against the last roar of wildness in his body, and also fighting against the fear of being completely lost.\nHowever, the silence was easily broken.\n\"Look, a precious specimen.\" A voice as cold as frost sounded at the entrance of the cave, without a trace of warmth.\nLiam's heart stopped. Outside the cave, torches suddenly lit up, reflecting the figures of the elite Illager hunting squad. The leader was a witch wearing a large purple pointed hat—Serena. Her gaze was like appraising an object, precise and cruel.\nThe instinct to survive made him grab the old iron sword he had kept with him, but his mutated palms could no longer hold the familiar hilt tightly. He tried to swing the sword, but the movement was clumsy and ridiculous. The blade slipped from his fur-covered, deformed palm and smashed onto the rock with a \"clang\", the crisp echo declaring how feeble the final resistance was.\n\"Poor thing,\" Serena raised the corner of her mouth contemptuously, her voice full of mockery, \"At this stage, you still want to clumsily imitate a human posture?\"\nShe didn't even strike personally, just gently waved her wand inlaid with amethyst. Several crimson figures darted out of the shadows like ghosts—they were red foxes, but by no means natural creatures. They had two swaying tails, their bodies burning with cold flickering blue flames, and eyes pulsing with pure purple light. They were Familiars, magical creations whose souls were completely twisted and obedient to their master.\nThey did not pounce and bite, but surrounded him in a disciplined circle, opening their mouths to spew scorching fox fire. The flames were not a scattered attack, but precisely formed a rotating ring of fire, trapping Liam firmly in the center. The scorching heat waves burned his fur and also incinerated his last hope.\n\"Woo—!\" Liam let out a desperate roar, trying to forcefully break through the ring of fire.\nBut Serena had already taken out a bottle of potion churning with black foam from her robe—a terrifying mixture of special catalyst and curse corruption fluid. She shattered the potion bottle on the rock at Liam's feet without hesitation.\n\"Bang!\"\nPurple smoke exploded instantly, like living tentacles, frantically drilling into his mouth and nose, penetrating every inch of his fur. Intense pain swept everything instantly, far exceeding any previous transformation pain. He felt as if his bones were dissolved and then reshaped by brute force, his vocal cords shrank rapidly, no longer able to utter human syllables. The most terrifying thing was the invasion of consciousness, as if countless red-hot steel needles were piercing his memories and thoughts, trying to completely strip the name \"Liam Thorne\" and all his past from his soul.\n\"No... I... am... Liam...\" He struggled desperately, trying to shout this final self-declaration, but what rushed out of his throat was only a string of rapid, sharp wails belonging completely to a beast.\nBefore his consciousness was completely swallowed by the endless purple-blackness, the last frozen image in his blurred vision was Serena's emotionless, pale face, and the collar in her hand shimmering with eerie runes, slowly approaching his neck.\nThe cold metal touch pressed against his skin, like the last tombstone falling, burying his short and struggling life."

      "content": "Chapter 4: The Witch's Red Shadow\nLiam Thorne, in that moment, indeed died.\nWhat survived was a creation called \"Red\".\nIt was a near-perfect Familiar. Its size far exceeded ordinary foxes, limbs slender and powerful, standing still like a crimson sculpture. Its fur seemed woven from solidified flames, flowing with dazzling luster under the light. Behind it, two fluffy divergent tails were like a king's robe, balancing its every explosive movement. It could not stand upright like a human, nor could its forelimbs perform fine movements like grasping or opening latches—but this did not affect it being a lethal weapon born for slaughter.\nIt needed no weapons. Its body itself was a vessel and conduit for magic. High-concentration liquid magic replaced part of its blood, rushing through veins and meridians. It could \"see\" invisible magical ripples in the air through smell, precisely locating casters or magical traps. When running at full speed, its toes left fleeting scorch marks on the air. It could refine magic from its chest and spew cold fox fire bolts from its mouth—not ordinary fire, but mixed with twisted soul power. Once attached, it was like maggots in bones; ordinary water could not extinguish it at all.\nAnd what satisfied Serena most was its near-instinctive talent for alchemy. Although without dexterous hands, through the magic link deliberately established and constantly reinforced by the witch, it only needed to touch the materials on the brewing stand with its nose tip, and the pure magic in its body could act like the most skilled hands, instantly completing extraction, mixing, and catalysis. Bottles of excellent healing potions, harming potions, or deadly poisons were born from its seemingly harmless touch. Efficiency and purity even surpassed many human alchemists.\nIt was Witch Serena's proudest work, her most favored claw.\n\"Good boy, my Red.\" Serena often used her ring-adorned fingers to slowly comb the iconic tuft of snow-white hair on top of its head. Red would immediately lower its ears, squint its blue eyes meekly, and emit a satisfied purr from its throat. It remembered no \"before\". Serena's scent, voice, and magic fluctuations were its entire \"world\" and \"meaning\".\nIt followed Serena to raid village after village. The crimson figure shuttled between fences and houses like a ghost, picking out bottles of potions from a specially made saddlebag, smashing them precisely at the knees or feet of guards like throwing knives, watching them scream and fall in the poison mist. It ignited granaries with fox fire. The soaring blue firelight reflected the terrified fleeing faces of villagers. It had no ripples in its heart, only a hollow pleasure enhanced by magic feedback after completing a task. Every time it \"made a merit\", Serena would reward it with a bowl of warm, sweet meat soup shimmering with eerie purple light. Drinking it, strength would grow in its muscles and bones, while those already sparse and chaotic fragments in its mind would be washed further blurred, until completely sinking into a warm, purple chaos.\nSuch days lasted for a long time. Long enough that obedience became instinct like breathing, long enough that \"Red\" almost forgot that life could have any other feeling besides unconditional attachment to the witch and fleeting satisfaction after executing orders."

      "content": "Chapter 5: Silent Awakening\nThat bleak late autumn became the season when its world began to shatter.\nSerena received an urgent summons from the Evoker leader regarding a major plan called the \"Moon Essence Ritual\". She rarely showed a hint of solemnity, leaving in a hurry, locking Red alone in the magic-reinforced hut deep in the swamp.\n\"Guard here,\" her voice came through the heavy wooden door, calm but unquestionable, \"Destroy all intruders.\"\nRed murmured meekly, rested its chin on the cold stone steps, and began an endless wait. It listened to the monotonous dripping sound of the swamp, its gaze piercing the gray mist, always focused on the direction the master left. One day, two days, ten days... Time flowed slowly in silence, like frozen mud. The defensive runes flowing with purple halos on the eaves dimmed day by day as the magic link with the master decayed, eventually extinguishing completely, like a giant beast closing its last eye.\nThe real torture came from within. As a Familiar, it could sustain life through magic circulation, with minimal need for ordinary food. However, when the link with the master was completely severed, the pure magic reserve in its body dried up rapidly like a leaking pool. An unprecedented hunger began to gnaw at it—not just the emptiness of the stomach, but a nothingness penetrating the bone marrow and touching the soul, as if the foundation of its existence was being drawn out bit by bit.\nIt began to wander anxiously in the hut, claws unconsciously scratching deep marks on the floor. It knocked over the alchemy stand in the corner, mixing colorful herbs and shattered glass bottles; it tore up the thick carpet where it used to curl up, cotton flying like snowflakes. The frenzy caused by hunger gradually overwhelmed reason, and those blue eyes were occupied by a dying crimson.\nFinally, its gaze, as if pulled by an invisible thread, locked dead on that corner of the bedroom—that heavy oak chest imposed with multiple restriction spells. Even in the hungriest and most chaotic moments, the ban branded deep in the soul was still clear: \"Absolutely, do not touch.\"\nBut now, the instinct to survive, like a long-dormant volcano, violently broke through the rock layer named \"obedience\". A low roar mixed with pain and determination rolled out of Red's throat. It opened its mouth, mobilized the little remaining magic in its body, and a stream of ghostly blue fox fire spewed out violently, impacting the magic lock that had become fragile due to the master's departure.\n\"Hiss—\"\nAccompanied by a sound of magic shattering like a wail, the lock disintegrated. With a click, the lid popped open weakly.\nThere was no emergency dry food or magic supply as expected. Only a set of poorly maintained, rusty old-style guard iron armor, an ordinary iron sword with no magic fluctuation, and a notebook with a leather cover polished shiny and corners severely curled.\nRed approached hesitantly, nose twitching. There was the smell of sweat from years ago, a faint smell of blood, and a... smell of leather dried in the sun on the iron armor? This mixed scent made its heart tighten inexplicably, a shudder originating from deep in the soul running through its spine. It extended a claw, carefully nudging that diary in front of it, and then used its wet cold nose tip to gently arch open the cover.\nThose dense texts were just meaningless winding ink marks to it, a password of another world it could not understand.\nHowever, when its claw unconsciously pressed on a certain page—where a withered evening primrose petal, still faintly recognizable as pale purple, was carefully sandwiched—an indescribable electric current instantly pierced through its limbs and bones!\nNo magnificent memory images emerged, no sudden \"epiphany\" made it remember the name \"Liam Thorne\". It still thought it was \"Red\", a fox Familiar made by a witch.\nBut, when its gaze fell on the sketch drawn with charcoal in the corner of the same page—clumsy lines but full of emotion depicting several familiar wooden houses, a winding path, and the crooked old oak tree at the village entrance—two lines of hot, completely uncontrollable tears surged out of its long narrow fox eyes without warning, sliding down the fur of its cheeks, dripping onto the old page, spreading a small dark wet mark.\nAt that moment, its heart felt like it was ruthlessly gripped and twisted by an invisible hand. A huge, causeless sadness and anger that almost tore its chest apart erupted like dormant earth fire. It looked at the iron sword, a strong impulse driving it to hold familiar hilt, just like holding a part of itself—but what lifted was only a furry, soft paw pad. It wanted to shout, to question, to roar out the giant waves churning in its chest, but what rushed out of its throat were only suppressed and broken \"Whimper... Woo...\".\nIt still didn't know what was written in the diary, didn't know who it exactly was. But in the moment tears rolled down, an absolute cognition transcending memory, almost instinct, pierced through the chaos fog of years in its soul like the first light of dawn:\nAll this is wrong. This life is a twisted cage. That woman... took away something vital of it, something that cannot be replaced by any magic.\nIt must leave. Immediately, right now.\nIt lowered its head, picked up the diary carrying a silent cry as gently as possible, and carefully put it into its portable leather saddlebag—where poisons and healing potions were once stored. Then, it looked back one last time at the stone house that had imprisoned it for countless days and nights, without a trace of nostalgia.\nThe crimson figure was like a resolute arrow, breaking through the decaying door frame, plunging into the vast, humid, and free wilderness outside. It didn't know exactly where to go, but there was a faint but firm voice deep in its soul, pointing to the direction where the purple moon hung highest, coldest, and most ominous.\nThere, perhaps lay the answer to severing all this."

      "content": "Chapter 6: Silent Companion\nA two-tailed demon fox struggled to move an inch in the human world. Everyone who saw it would scream and run, or raise their bows and arrows.\nMeeting Ella and Ryan happened a month later. At that time, Red found the two trying to break out from a siege of zombies. \nThe burly human warrior was like a furious giant bear. He roared and wielded a terrifying giant axe. The axe blade cut through the air with a dull whistle. Every swing forcibly split a bloody gap in the surrounding zombie line. Rotten flesh and dark green body fluids splashed everywhere. A little further away, a female archer moved nimbly. Her arrows were precise and deadly. Every arrow shot from a tricky angle, pinning those zombies trying to sneak attack from the warrior's blind spot to the ground.\nPerfect coordination, but there were too many zombies; they poured out of the shadows endlessly.\n\"Watch your back!\" Warrior Ryan's roar was like a thunderclap.\nElla turned abruptly, pupils shrinking—three swift zombies had quietly groped to a few steps away from her, withered claws pouncing with a bloody stench. She retreated rapidly and drew an arrow, but the distance was too close! One arrow barely shot through the knee of the foremost one, but the other two's sharp claws had torn open her leather armor, leaving bloody marks on her arm and waist. Severe pain and loss of balance made her grunt, kneeling weakly on the ground, the bow and arrow slipping from her hand.\nRyan's eyes cracked with rage, but he was firmly entangled by the corpse group in front of him, unable to return for rescue immediately.\nJust as the zombie's claws were about to touch Ella's neck—\nA crimson figure shot out from the shadows like a meteor tearing the night curtain! It was not a beast's pounce, more like a living fire. It emitted a clear cry rather than a roar, instantly attracting the attention of all zombies. At the same time, a few points of ghostly blue fox fire drifted from it, landing precisely on the zombies, burning violently like maggots on bones. The air was instantly filled with a scorching stench and strange coldness.\nIn a flash, the zombies threatening Ella turned into burning wreckage.\nRyan finally broke through the siege with brute force, the giant axe sweeping out a space. He strode to Ella, the blood-stained axe held across his chest, his heavy chest heaving violently. His gaze, full of vigilance and hostility, locked firmly on that quieting two-tailed red fox.\nElla endured the pain and grabbed the bow on the ground, barely nocking an arrow, the tip also pointing at it.\nThe battlefield suddenly fell into a tense silence, with only the whimpering of zombies in the distance and the crackling of burning fire.\nRed did not run, nor did it bare its teeth and growl low, showing no threat. It just slowly lowered its body, then sat down, right on the ground illuminated by fox fire. It raised its head, those unique, serene lake-like blue eyes clearly reflecting Ryan's vigilant face and Ella's pale countenance.\nThere was no fierceness of a predator in there, nor the hollow purple glow common to Familiars, only a deep calm almost capable of piercing the soul, and a trace of imperceptible... tired kindness.\nIt looked at Ryan for a moment, then did something unexpected to both—it lowered its head, gently nudged the crude saddlebag on itself with its nose, and carefully picked out a small bottle of potion rippling with pink luster. Then, it walked to a few steps away from Ryan, gently placed the potion on the ground, and nudged it forward with its nose tip until the bottle rolled to Ryan's mud-stained war boots.\nHaving done all this, it retreated to its original place and sat down again, as if handing over some important token, waiting quietly for judgment.\nRyan was completely stunned. He looked at the healing potion, then at the red fox. The axe blade lowered slightly.\nElla slowly lowered her bow and arrow. Clutching the wound on her waist, she walked forward with difficulty and picked up the potion that still carried the animal's body warmth. She pulled out the cork, sniffed gently, and surprise flashed in her eyes. \"It's the smell of a high-grade healing potion... pure and mild.\" She whispered to Ryan, but her gaze could not move away from Red's eyes, \"It saved us. And... Ryan, look at its eyes. I've never seen such a 'monster'. There is no madness in its eyes, only...\"\nShe weighed her words, finally whispering: \"Only sadness and determination like a human.\"\nRed could not speak, only expressing in the most primitive way. It lowered its head, sharp claw tips sinking deep into the wet mud, scratching slowly and forcefully. The soil turned up, a crooked but recognizable circle gradually forming—it was the most terrifying mark in the night sky, the Cursed Moon. After drawing, it raised its head, looked over Ella's shoulder, gazing at the distant horizon for a long time. There, a hideous tower pierced the dark clouds; even from a distance, one could feel the ominous aura it emitted. It pointed firmly with its nose tip in that direction once.\nElla followed its gaze and shivered. \"You want to go there? That tower of the Pillagers?\"\nA short and low cry came from Red's throat, nodding heavily. Under the moonlight, its blue eyes reflected the outline of the distant tower, as if burning with silent flames.\n\"Do you know what that means?\" Ryan said gruffly, stopping wiping the axe handle, \"That place is a devil's den, the lair of those bastards. Going there is courting death.\"\nRed made no more movements, nor did it growl excitedly. It just turned its gaze back, looking quietly and deeply into Ella's eyes. There was no beastly anxiety in that gaze, no begging, only a near-transparent determination, and a desperate gamble placing all trust. It condensed its unspeakable past, undissipated curse, and all reasons pointing to that tower into this one look.\nElla fell silent in that gaze. She exchanged a look with Ryan and walked aside to discuss in a low voice. Firelight elongated their shadows, occasionally carrying a few vague words: \"...saved us\", \"...eyes are different\", \"...must be a reason\". Red sat patiently in place, like a crimson stone sculpture, only the slightly heaving chest proving its life.\nAfter a long time, Ella walked back. She squatted down, trying to meet Red's eyes as levelly as possible, her voice clear and solemn: \"We'll go with you.\"\nFrom that moment on, a peculiar team was born. Red naturally became the eyes and ears of the team, and the most unexpected supporter. It couldn't wield swords, but that crimson figure shuttled through the woods so fast only a shadow remained; it could warn of danger long in advance, a trace of unusual decay or metallic smell in the wind could not escape its nose tip. In battle, it was incredibly agile, always maneuvering in the gaps of axe winds and arrows, slamming its not-so-strong body into a skeleton arm about to scratch Ella's ankle, or precisely throwing a healing potion tightly held in its claws to within Ryan's reach the moment he parried. The inconspicuous small saddlebag on its back seemed connected to another space, always able to pull out herbs to relieve fatigue, antidotes, or deadly poisons that made enemies suffer unspeakably at the right time.\nAlthough it never uttered a word, tacit understanding was tempered in countless life-and-death struggles. They learned to recognize the angle of its ear turning, the frequency of its tail wagging; those were its language.\nThe camp at night was the most peaceful, but also the time when heavy hearts were revealed. Ryan polished his beloved giant axe by the firelight, Ella mended worn leather armor by moonlight. And Red, always curled up quietly at the edge of the firelight, carefully spreading that edge-worn diary in front of it. It couldn't read those winding texts, but its gaze would linger on the yellowed pages for a long time, especially the page with a dried evening primrose. It extended a claw, not to turn the page, but to brush over that fragile plant and the handwriting beside it extremely lightly and softly, as if touching a fragile dream, a hometown that could not be returned to.\nFirelight danced in its focused blue eyes, illuminating a deep emotion far beyond beasts. Ryan and Ella looked at such a Red, and the initial doubt and barrier in their hearts had long been replaced by a quiet realization.\nThey understood that walking beside them was not a cursed beast.\nWithin that red fox body, imprisoned a wounded, but unyielding, noble soul."

      "content": "Chapter 7: Raid on the Obsidian Fortress\nOn the day of the decisive battle, the sky hung low, and the \"Cursed Moon\" hung above the Obsidian Fortress like a pulsating evil heart. The moonlight was thick enough to be almost liquid, dyeing the entire mountain range into a ghostly purple-red.\nInside the fortress, the evil ritual had reached its climax. Relying on Red's instinctive perception of Illager aura and magic veins, they moved like shadows through the heavily guarded corridors and halls, avoiding several patrols, and finally reached the core hall.\nHowever, the last line of defense could not be bypassed, and the battle was tragic beyond the limit that flesh and blood could bear.\nThe skylight of the hall dome was open, and a thick, solid purple light column fell from the \"Cursed Moon\", becoming the energy core of the entire evil ritual. Under the light column stood the existence that had shaped and imprisoned everything about Red—Witch Serena. Beside her stood the tyrant of the Pillager legion, a giant clad in heavy armor and holding an enchanted great axe haunted by ominous black gas. Just standing there, he emitted a mountain-like oppression.\n\"Oh my...\" Serena's gaze swept over Ella and Ryan, finally riveting on Red, the corner of her mouth curling up in a cold and twisted smile, \"Look who it is? My lost... little pet. Have you wandered enough and come back to beg for your master's forgiveness?\"\n\"Woo—Roar—!!!\"\nThe moment it saw Serena, the pain accumulated over years, the nothingness transformed from erased memories, and the anger gnawing at the soul day and night after waking up, erupted like a suppressed volcano! Red let out a roar that resounded through the hall, mixing fox howl with some remnant human wail. The two tails behind it suddenly fluffed up like battle flags, every hair bursting with blinding azure light! The accumulated fox fire was no longer reserved, turning into a surging wall of flames several meters high, booming towards Serena and the tyrant with Ryan's battle axe in a desperate momentum to burn everything!\nThe tyrant moved. The great axe did not block, but slashed frontally with pure brute force! The axe blade tore through the wall of fire, and the exploding shock wave cracked the ground stone slabs into spider webs. In a collision of strength against strength without any fancy tricks, the steel shield engraved with Ryan's family crest shattered instantly! He smashed against the distant stone wall like a kite with a broken string, slid to the ground with a muffled sound, and moved no more.\n\"Ryan!\" As soon as Ella's scream came out, several Vexes condensed from resentment and purple moon energy penetrated her arrow blockade like ghosts, their sharp swords deeply embedded in her shoulder and ribs. She fell coughing up blood, the bow in her hand clattering to the ground, her vision rapidly eroded by blood color and darkness.\nRed wanted to pounce on Ella, but a cold chain from the soul level suddenly tightened—Serena's immobilization spell hit him precisely. Magic entangled its limbs like ice chains. It could only crawl on the ground in humiliation, watching its teammates fall, squeezing broken whimpers from its throat.\nSerena walked to Red with elegant and cruel steps, looking down at its struggling appearance. Under the blasphemous purple moonlight, she held high a dagger with a weird shape and a blade engraved with wriggling runes, the cold light reflecting the pure indifference and desire for control in her eyes.\n\"What a touching friendship, and how... stupid.\" Her voice was as soft as a snake flicking its tongue, \"Since you can't learn loyalty, then stay by my side in an eternal way. Your fur and bones will become the most special piece in my collection.\"\nDespair, like the deepest ice water, drowned Red's chest. It looked at Ryan whose life or death was unknown, at Ella whose breath was weak in the pool of blood, and finally at the moon outside the skylight that was so oddly purple as if mocking all beings. Amidst the violent struggle, the sheepskin diary slipped out of its saddlebag and lay open on the ground—exactly the page sandwiching the withered evening primrose.\nIn a trance, the faded ink marks and the withered petals seemed to overlap, and a distant and firm voice penetrated the barrier of time and the mist of memory, echoing weakly but clearly in the depths of the soul:\n\"No matter what I become... I must protect...\"\nProtect.\nThis word, like the final key, suddenly opened all the locks of entanglement and confusion. It didn't come to find a way to turn back into Liam Thorne—that human named Liam had already passed away in the purple smoke many years ago. It came here, crossing wilderness and battles, enduring loneliness and pain, not for the purpose of \"going back\" at all.\nBut for the end.\nTo end this source that created countless tragedies, twisted lives, and blasphemed the moonlight. To end Serena's ambition, to end the tyrant's tyranny, to end all curses projected by this \"Cursed Moon\"!\nIts gaze fell on its chest—where hung an old metal ring of unknown use found by chance on the road, engraved with patterns of stars and crescents on the edge: Moon Marrow Cross Ring.\nA segment of almost forgotten ancient proverb roared like a warning bell at this moment: \"Moon Marrow Ring, only entrusted when the Cursed Moon is at its peak... can contain the brilliance of overload, break the shackles of form... but the life of the walker is also fuel for it.\"\nThe price is... life.\nBut, enough.\nIn Red's eyes, that deep blue, under the reflection of the purple moonlight, ignited a calm and resolute flame for the last time."

      "content": "Chapter 8: Lord of the Spirit Realm\nRed suddenly raised its head, bones in its neck cracking crisply. It didn't use the last remaining magic for attack or escape, but poured it all into its limbs, forcibly shattering the frozen shackles on the soul level! The moment the restraints disintegrated, it didn't hesitate at all, lowered its head, and bit fiercely towards its neck with sharp canine teeth—\nCrack.\nThat ancient Moon Marrow Cross Ring shattered in response.\nNot shattering, but releasing. The ancient starlight imprisoned within the ring and Red's accumulated magic turned into a silent ripple spreading out.\n\"Awoo——————!!!\"\nWhat burst out next was a fox howl transcending the auditory category. The sound wave wrapped the broken ring runes and Red's resolute will, exploding in a ring shape. All window lattices, crystal chandeliers, and even magic embedded pieces on the walls in the hall were shaken into powder instantly!\nAbove the sky dome, that \"Cursed Moon\" trembled violently, as if drawn by this wail. All the scattered, diffuse purple moonlight nourishing the evil ritual, like hundreds of rivers returning to the sea, suddenly contracted and condensed, turning into a destruction light column several meters in diameter, solid as liquid amethyst, pouring in from the skylight with a boom, completely swallowing Red's figure!\n\"What is that?! Stop it! Quick!\" Serena's gaffe scream was drowned in the roar of pure energy.\nToo late.\nInside the light column, Red's form began to disintegrate. The flame-like fur vaporized first, revealing the meridians shining with ghostly blue luster below; flesh and blood did not rot, but sublimated into bits of starlight; bones were recast in melting, emitting the sound of metal and stone clashing. That was not demise, but a grand and painful sacrifice—using the old, cursed \"existence\" as firewood to ignite a higher birth.\nWhen the blinding light gradually faded, what appeared in place was no longer the familiar of the past.\nIt was an elegant, majestic spiritual existence flowing with a quiet aura of destruction. Its size was nearly doubled, and the originally crimson fur turned into profound dark blue, with nebula vortices seemingly rotating slowly within. It still stepped on the earth, but the space under its four feet slightly distorted, rippling out circles of light blue. The most striking were the two tails—they had completely turned into pure spiritual flames, no longer solid, the tail tips dancing with ghostly light blue halos, dragging dreamlike light trails in the air. And on its chest, where the collar was once bound, a complex and precise blue rune rotating slowly by itself shone brightly, like a third eye, staring coldly at the world.\nRed, the \"Red\" as a familiar, ceased to exist.\nWhat descended at this moment was the one in charge of the dark side of the moon, governing the authority of curse and end—\nLord of the Spirit Realm.\nThe chain magic missiles hurriedly shot by Serena, upon touching the psionic field naturally rippling around it, annihilated silently like snowflakes falling into hot iron. The Pillager tyrant let out a roar like a trapped beast, waving the great axe that had shattered the shield and was haunted by black gas, hacking down with full force like splitting a mountain!\nThe Lord of the Spirit Realm didn't even look straight at him, just tilted its head slightly, and a spiritual fire tail behind it rose casually as if having an independent will, swiping lightly.\nClang—!\nA crisp breaking sound rang out. The enchanted Netherite axe blade capable of cutting through fine steel snapped in two. The tail's momentum didn't dissipate, hitting the tyrant's chest frontally like an invisible giant hammer. That mountain-like body immediately shot backward like a stone thrown by a trebuchet, embedding fiercely into a distant stone pillar. Spider-web-like cracks instantly spread throughout the pillar, and he breathed no more.\nSerena finally slumped to the ground, blood draining from her face, lips trembling: \"No... this shouldn't exist... this power... is taboo...\"\nThe Lord of the Spirit Realm paced forward slowly, light frost condensing on the ground it stepped on. It still couldn't speak, but those eyes burning with eternal blue flames needed no language. There was no hatred, no pleasure, only an absolute judgment meaning belonging to a higher law.\nIt stopped a few steps in front of the witch and slowly opened its mouth. Not to bite. Inside the mouth, a point of extreme blue gloom began to compress and condense crazily, and the surrounding space collapsed inward because of it, emitting a low hum.\nThe last thing reflected in Serena's pupils was the blue star swallowing all light, and the bottomless, calm meaning of end in the eyes of the Lord of the Spirit Realm.\nBoom——————!!!\nA devastating blue light stream surged out, instantly swallowing Serena's body, the evil altar behind her, the rune pedestal carrying the ritual, and even the heavy obsidian wall at the rear of the hall. Where the light reached, matter returned to nothingness.\nThe entire fortress began to groan under the overwhelming burden, and amidst the earth-shaking vibration, it collapsed layer by layer from top to bottom.\nThe Lord of the Spirit Realm stood in the center of the constantly falling boulders and churning energy turbulence, its ghostly blue figure like the eye of a storm, serene, and eternal."

      "content": "Epilogue: Legend of the Moon Glow\nWhen the first ray of true dawn pierced the curtain of the long dark night like molten platinum, the eerie \"Cursed Moon\" in the sky finally exhausted its last trace of strength and sank silently below the horizon, leaving only a faint, rapidly fading purple smudge in the sky.\nThe Obsidian Fortress had turned into a smoking ruin of jagged teeth. Ella dragged a leg that could barely move, supporting the unconscious Ryan, staggering forward among the rubble. Every call pulled the wound on her shoulder blade pierced by the Vex, bringing burning severe pain.\n\"Red! Red—! Answer me!\"\nHer voice echoed over the empty ruins, carrying increasing panic. Dust, shattered magic crystals, and a scorched smell filled the air.\nFinally, on a relatively flat broken stone slab whose edges were scorched black by moonlight, she found it.\nThe magnificent form of the Lord of the Spirit Realm had dissipated. Curling up there at this moment was the original appearance—that not-so-strong red fox with two fluffy tails. It lay on its side, body slightly curled, in a posture relaxed to the point of peacefulness. That signature orange-red coat still shimmered with flame-like luster under the dawn, clean and intact, without any wounds or stains left by the battle.\nHowever, the once warm heaving arc of its chest had stilled. Those eyes that had reflected complex emotions—sometimes confused, sometimes firm, and finally turned into divine majesty—were tightly closed at this moment. Long eyelashes cast shallow shadows on the pale face, the expression peaceful, as if it had just fallen into a dreamless, exceptionally deep sleep.\nThe sheepskin diary that witnessed all its struggles and existence was spread out in front of its small, black nose tip, intact. The wind turned the pages, finally stopping on that withered evening primrose.\nElla's fingers trembled uncontrollably. She fell on her knees on the cold stone slab, reached out, and carefully checked its breath. What came from her fingertips was only the gradually dissipating residual warmth and a heartbreaking silence. No breathing. On this continent filled with miracles and curses, potions and magic, there are always some laws higher than everything, and some prices that even the most taboo rituals cannot redeem.\nIt paid everything it could pay. Magic, body, and even that wisp of soul fire constituting \"existence\" itself, all ignited the light that illuminated the darkness and ended the curse at that moment.\nA suppressed-to-the-extreme whimper squeezed out of Ella's throat, immediately turning into uncontrollable wailing. She leaned down and buried her face deeply in the fur on Red's neck that was still soft but rapidly losing temperature. Tears mixed with blood stains soaked that bright crimson. Above the ruins, only the sad wind whimpered, echoing the elegy of humans losing a Comrade-in-arms and the world losing a nameless guardian.\n...\nTime passed. In the ballads sung by bards and the whispers of travelers around the stove at night later, there was another version of the ending of that decisive battle:\nThey say that on every night when the \"Cursed Moon\" rises again, if you harbor pure kindness but unfortunately get lost in the dense forest, or are covered by monsters due to whispers in the dark, you might be lucky enough to witness a miracle.\nOn the top of distant hills, or at the boundary of the mist forest, a two-tailed fox spirit body will appear. It is surrounded by quiet and eternal ghostly and blue spiritual fire, as if draping a starry sky over its body. It will not speak, nor ever approach, only standing quietly at the junction of moonlight and shadow.\nIts eyes burning with blue flames will look at you across the distance. There are no words in that gaze, but it seems to be able to disperse all the wriggling malice and cold fear around.\nThen, you will find the entangled thorns on the road you came from quietly retreating, the uneasy rustling sound gradually fading away, and a path illuminated by hazy moonlight clearly appears under your feet, leading to the direction of home.\nThe poets lower their voices and tell you with awe and nostalgia:\nThat is not the wandering of a dead soul.\nThat is the last Lord of the Spirit Realm on this land that has borne too much pain, fulfilling a vow never spoken in its only known way.\nIt became the most silent and most loyal under the moonlight—\nEternal Night Watcher."

Abstract\nThis experiment aims to investigate whether the newborn creature can undergo additional modifications.\n\nII. Materials\n1. Subject 13: Human with moderate Red Fox morphological changes.\n2. Moon Dust Crystal: To test if further curse modification is possible.\n3. Experimental Catalyst: To test if it accelerates the curse process.\n4. Binding Collar (Test Type): To test control efficacy.\n\nIII. Environment\nPurple Moon: Variable uncontrollable, but mandatory.\n\nIV. Procedure\n1. Secure the subject to the center of the Moonwell.\n2. Force administration of Experimental Catalyst.\n3. Equip Binding Collar post-transformation.\n4. Administer Moon Dust Crystal.\n\nV. Results\nPhase 1: Subject showed distress after catalyst administration. Physical changes accelerated significantly compared to normal rates, visible to the naked eye, with intensified surrounding psionic fluctuations.\nPhase 2: Subject began convulsing. Body completely transformed into a Red Fox, but with two tails. Low-temperature blue fire began to emerge around it.\nPhase 3: Aggression towards Illagers and Witches was near zero, but showed intense hostility towards Villagers.\nPhase 4: Subject was completely controlled after a Witch equipped the collar; obeyed self-harm commands.\nPhase 5: After consuming diluted Moon Dust Crystal, subject lost control. Body size increased, showing intense aggression. The emitted blue fire exhibited anomalous properties—causing both burns and frostbite. Lowest recorded temperature reached -10°C. Subject died after ~30 seconds of rampage. Autopsy revealed ruptured energy storage organs; internal organs were scorched and frozen.\n\nVII. Analysis\nConsistent with previous results. Subject died after consuming Moon Dust Crystal, even at extremely low diluted dosages. Extensive testing indicates the Familiar Red Fox cannot undergo deep modification; it has reached its curse threshold.\n\nVIII. Recommendation\nCease further strength research on Familiars. The damage caused by each experiment has cost the Illagers multiple key researchers. Even if successful consumption and evolution were achieved, it would likely result in an uncontrollable berserk beast.\n\nSignature: <REDACTED>\nStatus: Project Terminated - TOP SECRET"

      "author": "Bedtime Stories",
      "content": "Long, long ago, in a place very, very far away, deep in an ancient forest filled with fog, when the last ray of sunshine hid behind the treetops, something else quietly awakened.\n\nIt was a squad of incredibly brave people. Their armor shone like mirrors during the day, and the swords in their hands were sharper than winter icicles. But once inside this pitch-black jungle, their courage vanished bit by bit, like a sugar cube melting in hot water, leaving not even a trace of sweetness.\n\n\"Run! Don't look back!\"\n\nThey ran on small paths covered in moss and tangled vines, vines that wrapped around their boots like snakes. The moon was so scared it hid inside thick clouds, daring not to take a single peek down. The wind shuttled through the treetops, seeming to whisper, or perhaps clearing the way for something.\n\nNo one saw what it looked like. It didn't roar like a lion, nor howl like a wolf. It was like a cold wind that never blew, like a shadow never cast. It was blacker than the night, quieter than silence.\n\nThe person running at the very back held a dim lantern tightly in his hand. That was their only hope, like a star in this boundless darkness. But, in that instant, the light was snuffed out as if by an invisible hand, and even the person holding the lantern disappeared with it. No scream, no struggle, not even the sound of armor clashing. It was as if that person never existed; he simply melted into that thick night, like a drop of water falling into the sea.\n\nThe man carrying a huge shield always believed that the shield behind him could withstand anything. But the moment he stopped abruptly and raised his shield to look back, a mist happened to drift over his feet—when the mist cleared, both man and shield were gone, leaving only a few crushed fallen leaves on the ground, retaining a bit of strange shape.\n\nFear climbed up everyone's spine like cold fingers. They could only hear each other's heavy breathing, sounding like broken bellows wheezing.\n\nThe forest became denser and denser, as if the trees were also huddled together in fear. The patterns on those trunks twisted in the darkness, like strange faces silently watching these poor escaping wretches.\n\nTwo more people vanished. They were running hand in hand, thinking they wouldn't be separated this way. However, that invisible force cut their connection as easily as cutting a harp string. The person on the left tightly held that warm hand, while the person on the right had long vanished without a trace.\n\nFinally, only one adventurer was left.\n\nHe was so lonely, as if thrown into a pitch-black boundless sea. He ran nonstop, gasping for breath, his boot soles filled with cold mud, his cheeks scratched with messy bloody marks by thorns. But he dared not stop—he could feel that thing sticking behind him like a shadow. It was neither fast nor slow, as if toying with the prey in its palm, savoring every bit of his fear and despair.\n\nFinally, just when he thought his heart was about to jump out, the forest came to an end. Like a frightened rat, he rushed headlong into that open grassland.\n\nOn the other end of the horizon, the warm sun slowly rose, golden rays dispelling that suffocating darkness. The adventurer tilted his head back, closed his eyes, enjoying the warm sunshine, his heart full of the ecstasy of a lucky escape.\n\nThe rising sun stretched his shadow very, very long. That long black shadow silently extended backward, all the way into that gloomy forest he had just fled from, and at the end of the shadow, a dark figure was staring at his back...\n\n\"And then?\"\n\nA tender voice asked.\n\nThe child opened his big eyes, hands tightly gripping the edge of the sheet, looking at the gentle figure sitting by the bed with both fear and curiosity.\n\nThe mother gently closed the book with a slightly worn cover in her hand, a mysterious smile on her face. She reached out, her fingertips gently brushing across the child's flushed cheek, and tucked the corner of the quilt tighter.\n\n\"And then,\" the mother's voice was as soft as humming a lullaby, \"because dawn came, and monsters in the forest are most afraid of sunlight, just like snowmen are afraid of stoves, so that adventurer was saved.\"\n\nThe child nodded seemingly understanding but not quite, but a trace of doubt still remained in his eyes. He shrank into the warm quilt, revealing only a pair of jet-black eyes, and asked in a low voice: \"Mom, is this monster real? Is it really like a ghost, that no one can catch it?\"\n\nThe mother stood up, walked to the window, and drew that thin layer of gauze curtain, blocking the pitch-black night outside.\n\n\"Of course it's true, my little darling,\" she said softly, with a hint of that exaggeration peculiar to scaring children in her tone, \"It comes out specially at night to catch those children who are still naughty and refuse to close their eyes when it's bedtime.\"\n\nHearing this, the child immediately closed his eyes tightly, his breathing becoming careful. She walked back to the bed, left a kiss on the child's forehead, and turned off the lamp.\n\nThe room fell into a peaceful darkness, with only the moon outside the window, still like a silver eye, quietly watching it all.\n\n\"Only disobedient children... will be caught.\""
